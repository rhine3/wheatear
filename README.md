# wheatear

Wheatear is in development. Its goal is to be a birdsong learning aid for any geographic location. Using Xeno-canto recordings as its source, Wheatear will be a free, open-source learning tool for scientists and birders alike.

The most desired features are:

Recording selectivity
* Allow users to download recordings for species with a range in a given geographic location (e.g., "Panama")
* Allow users to select what quality of file to download

Learning
* Teach by ramping up difficulty, mixing more species in as time goes on
* Group similar-sounding birds together
* Repeat sounds until recall is perfect

Customizability
* Ability to create personalized species playlists
* Easy removal of unwanted recordings
* Reproducible and user-creatable "bird packs" consisting of XC catalog numbers
* A spectrogram on/off option for NFCs and for song learning (not recommended for later stages of song quizzing)

Community contributions
* A community rating system for recordings to filter out low-quality recordings or ones with too many species
* Community-recommended recording edits, e.g., only playing back particular portions of recordings

Soundscape mode
* Test your ability to identify species from soundscapes

Ethics
* Give proper credit and exposure to Xeno-canto recordists
* Solicit donations to conservation agencies
